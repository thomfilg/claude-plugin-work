# Orchestrate Command

Runs `/work` for multiple ticket tasks sequentially, completing one before starting the next.
**Each task runs in its own worktree with isolated Claude session history.**

## Usage

```
/orchestrate <task-ids...>
```

**Examples:**
- `/orchestrate 851 853 899` - Work on 3 tasks sequentially
- `/orchestrate PROJ-851` - Work on single task
- `/orchestrate 851 853 899 456` - Work on 4 tasks

## Instructions

### Step 1: Parse task IDs

Extract task IDs from input. If only numbers provided, prefix with your project key:

```bash
# Input: "851 853 899" or "PROJ-851 PROJ-853"
# Output: ["PROJ-851", "PROJ-853", "PROJ-899"]
```

Store the list of tasks to process.

### Step 2: Initialize tracking

Create a tracking structure for the orchestration:

```
TASKS_TO_PROCESS = [PROJ-851, PROJ-853, PROJ-899]
CURRENT_INDEX = 0
COMPLETED = []
FAILED = []
```

### Step 3: Display initial plan

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
               ORCHESTRATE: Sequential Work
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Tasks to process (in order):
  1. PROJ-851  → ~/worktrees/${REPO_NAME}-PROJ-851
  2. PROJ-853  → ~/worktrees/${REPO_NAME}-PROJ-853
  3. PROJ-899  → ~/worktrees/${REPO_NAME}-PROJ-899

Each task will run in its own worktree with isolated session.

Starting with task 1 of 3...
```

### Step 4: Sequential execution loop

For EACH task in the list, execute sequentially:

```
FOR i = 0 TO length(TASKS_TO_PROCESS) - 1:
    TASK_ID = TASKS_TO_PROCESS[i]
    WORKTREE_PATH = "$HOME/worktrees/${REPO_NAME}-${TASK_ID}"

    1. Display progress banner:
       ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    TASK {i+1} OF {TOTAL}: {TASK_ID}
       ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
       Worktree: ${WORKTREE_PATH}

    2. Bootstrap worktree if not exists:
       - Check: git worktree list | grep ${TASK_ID}
       - If not exists, run /bootstrap for this task first
       - This creates the worktree, branch, and draft PR

    3. Spawn new Claude session in worktree:
       ```bash
       cd ${WORKTREE_PATH} && claude -p "/work ${TASK_ID}"
       ```

       IMPORTANT: This spawns a NEW Claude CLI process that:
       - Runs in the worktree directory
       - Has its own session history (stored in worktree/.claude/)
       - Executes /work in isolation
       - Returns when /work completes

    4. Wait for Claude session to complete entirely
       - /work handles: implement → test → PR
       - Do NOT proceed until the spawned session finishes

    5. Check result:
       - If /work completed successfully (exit code 0):
         COMPLETED.push(TASK_ID)
       - If /work failed or was blocked:
         FAILED.push({TASK_ID, reason})
         Ask user: "Continue with next task? (Y/n)"
         - If no: EXIT loop

    6. Display transition message:
       ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       ✅ {TASK_ID} complete. Moving to next task...
       ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Step 5: Handle failures gracefully

If a `/work` invocation fails or gets blocked:

```
⚠️  TASK BLOCKED: PROJ-853

Reason: [reason from /work]

Options:
1. Continue with next task (PROJ-899)
2. Stop orchestration

Completed so far: PROJ-851
Remaining: PROJ-899
```

Use AskUserQuestion to let user decide:
- **Continue** - Skip the failed task and move to next
- **Stop** - End orchestration, show summary

### Step 6: Final summary

After all tasks processed (or user stops):

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
              ORCHESTRATION COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Monitor ↔ Agent Unblocking Protocol (MANDATORY)

When you (as orchestrator/monitor) receive a message from a worker agent on
its channel and decide to take action to unblock it, you MUST follow this
three-step communication protocol so the agent knows what's happening:

1. **ACK — "I'm starting work to unblock you."**
   Send IMMEDIATELY upon receiving the blocker, BEFORE any code change.
   ```bash
   node ~/p/w-claude-plugin/claude-plugin-work/scripts/communicate.js <TICKET> \
     "monitor: ACK — starting work to unblock <one-line summary>. Stand by."
   ```

2. **Do the changes.**
   Diagnose, edit code, run tests, commit, push. The agent waits.

3. **DONE — "You are unblocked."**
   Send when the fix is shipped (committed AND pushed if on a PR branch).
   Message MUST include:
   - The exact commit hash + branch / PR number
   - One-line description of the fix
   - The exact command the agent should re-invoke to resume
   ```bash
   node ~/p/w-claude-plugin/claude-plugin-work/scripts/communicate.js <TICKET> \
     "monitor: UNBLOCKED at commit <hash> on <branch> (PR #<n>). <one-line fix>. Retry: <exact command>"
   ```

**Why this is mandatory:**
- Agents have no visibility into your work. Without ACK they assume the
  message was lost and either retry endlessly or give up.
- Without DONE they don't know whether to keep waiting or resume.
- Silent fixes look identical to no fix — agents cannot tell.

**Rules:**
- Never silently fix and walk away. Both messages are required.
- ACK goes out FIRST, before you read deeply, edit, or spawn agents.
- DONE goes out LAST, after the fix is verifiably live (push completed).
- If the fix takes long, send progress pings every ~10 minutes
  (`monitor: still working — <what you're doing now>`).
- If you decide NOT to act (false alarm, out of scope, etc.), send a
  CLOSED message with the reason instead of going silent:
  `monitor: CLOSED — not acting because <reason>. <next step for you>`.

## Key Behaviors

### Sequential Execution (CRITICAL)
- **NEVER** run tasks in parallel
- **ALWAYS** wait for `/work` to complete before starting next
- Each task gets full attention and resources

### Context Isolation
- Each `/work` invocation is independent
- Failures in one task don't affect others
- Worktrees are separate per task

### Progress Visibility
- Clear banners between tasks
- Running count (e.g., "Task 2 of 5")
- Summary shows all results at end

## Error Recovery

### If Claude session gets stuck
```
Claude session has been running for extended time on PROJ-853.
Check worktree: ~/worktrees/${REPO_NAME}-PROJ-853

Manual options:
1. Kill the stuck process: Ctrl+C or find/kill the claude process
2. cd ~/worktrees/${REPO_NAME}-PROJ-853
3. Check git status, test status manually
4. Resume work: claude -p "/work PROJ-853"
```

### If orchestration interrupted
```
Orchestration was interrupted at task 2 of 5.

Completed: PROJ-851
In progress: PROJ-853
Remaining: PROJ-899, PROJ-456, PROJ-789

To resume remaining tasks: /orchestrate 853 899 456 789
To resume single task: cd ~/worktrees/${REPO_NAME}-PROJ-853 && claude -p "/work"
```

### Checking progress from main terminal
```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Check session history for a specific task
ls -la ~/worktrees/${REPO_NAME}-PROJ-853/.claude/

# View recent Claude output (if running)
tail -f /tmp/claude-orchestrate-PROJ-853.log
```

## Notes

- Default project key: configured via `TICKET_PROJECT_KEY` env var (falls back to `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY`)
- Each task gets its own worktree via `/bootstrap`
- Each task runs in a **separate Claude CLI session**
- Session history is stored in each worktree's `.claude/` folder
- All `/work` behaviors apply (implement, test, PR)
- Use this for batch processing related tasks
- Best for independent tasks that don't depend on each other

## Session Isolation Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Isolated history** | Each task's conversation is in its own worktree |
| **Independent context** | No cross-contamination between tasks |
| **Resumable** | Can resume any task by going to its worktree |
| **Reviewable** | Check `.claude/` in any worktree to see what happened |
| **Clean failures** | One task failing doesn't corrupt others |

## Spawning Claude Sessions

The orchestrator uses `claude -p` to spawn sessions:

```bash
# Spawns Claude in the worktree directory with /work command
cd $HOME/worktrees/${REPO_NAME}-PROJ-851 && \
  claude -p "/work PROJ-851" 2>&1 | tee /tmp/claude-orchestrate-PROJ-851.log

# The -p flag runs the prompt and exits when done
# Output is logged for review
```

This ensures:
- Claude runs in the correct directory (worktree)
- Session history is stored in the worktree
- Output can be monitored via log file
- Exit code indicates success/failure
