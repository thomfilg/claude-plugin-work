#
# Bootstrap multiple tickets at once for parallel /work agents:
#
#   1. Source ../.envrc (if present) to pick up WORKTREES_BASE, REPO_NAME,
#      BASE_BRANCH, BOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT — same convention work-workflow uses.
#   2. Per ticket: create worktree at <WORKTREES_BASE>/<REPO_NAME>-<TICKET>
#      from <BASE_BRANCH> on a new branch named after <TICKET>.
#   3. Run work-workflow's bootstrap-custom-script.js if installed (honours
#      $BOOTSTRAP_SCRIPT just like /work-workflow:bootstrap does). Skipped
#      gracefully if the helper isn't found.
#   4. Launch a <TICKET>-work tmux session running
#      `$CLAUDE_BIN --dangerously-skip-permissions '/$SKILL_NAME <TICKET>'`.
#
# Idempotent: skips tickets that already have a worktree or tmux session.

# Usage:
