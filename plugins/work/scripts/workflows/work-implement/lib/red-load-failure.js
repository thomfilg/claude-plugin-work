/**
 * red-load-failure.js
 *
 * Shared heuristic for detecting RED-phase load failures: test runs whose
 * non-zero exit reflects a load-time error (ReferenceError / SyntaxError /
 * missing module) or a runner that executed zero tests, rather than a real
 * assertion failure. Accepting such runs as RED wedges the subsequent GREEN
 * because the same crash repeats regardless of source edits (see GH-508
 * Task 6, fixed by GH-532).
 *
 * Exported so `tdd-phase-state.js record-red` and future consumers
 * (e.g. `enforce-tdd-on-stop.js`) share the exact patterns and scan
 * semantics without copy-paste drift.
 *
 * RUNNER ASSUMPTION — node:test ONLY:
 *   The detector assumes node:test TAP output shape, where failing-test
 *   diagnostics are wrapped in `---` / `...` YAML envelopes. The YAML guard
 *   in `shouldSkipLine` is what prevents a real failing test whose body
 *   throws `ReferenceError` (emitted by the runner under `error: |-`) from
 *   being misclassified as a load failure.
 *
 *   jest / vitest / mocha do NOT emit those envelopes. A real failing test
 *   under those runners that throws `ReferenceError:` / `SyntaxError:`
 *   would be falsely rejected here. Today the repo is node:test-only (see
 *   `plugins/work/CLAUDE.md` → "Node built-in test runner"), so this is
 *   acceptable.
 *
 *   If support for jest / vitest / mocha is ever added, the heuristic must
 *   be revised to require the load-failure signature to appear BEFORE the
 *   first `TAP version` line (i.e. during test-file load, before the
 *   runner has started reporting). Until then, do not reuse this module
 *   against output from other runners.
