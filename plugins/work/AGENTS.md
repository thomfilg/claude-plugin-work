# Agents

19 specialized agents in `agents/`. Dispatched via `Task()` — never self-invoke recursively.

For project overview and development rules see **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)**.
For detailed documentation see **[docs/README.md](./docs/README.md)**.

## Review guidelines

- This is a Claude Code plugin — **CommonJS only** (`require`/`module.exports`). Do not suggest ES modules.
- **No TypeScript** — plain JavaScript. Do not suggest adding types or `.d.ts` files.
- Tests use **`node:test`** + **`node:assert/strict`**. Do not suggest Jest, Vitest, or Mocha.
- Hooks use `process.exit(0/1/2)` intentionally — 0=allow, 2=block. Do not suggest throwing errors instead.
- **Fail-open is intentional** — hooks catch errors and exit 0. Do not suggest fail-closed alternatives.
- `logHookError(__filename, err)` is the logging convention. Do not suggest `console.error`.
- Config lives in `scripts/workflows/lib/config.js` — do not duplicate its logic elsewhere.
- `Object.create(null)` prevents prototype pollution — intentional, do not flag.
- Content inside `skills/**/SKILL.md` and `agents/*.md` are AI instruction documents, not executable code. Do not flag code fences inside them.
- `protect-state-files.js` four-vector design is intentional. Do not simplify regex patterns.
- Shell command interpolation from git commands (not user input) is safe — do not flag as injection.

## TDD RED rejection: test-load failures (GH-532)

`record-red` (in `tdd-phase-state.js`) rejects test runs whose output contains
a top-level load-failure signature instead of an assertion failure:

- `ReferenceError:` outside `assert.throws`
- `SyntaxError:` from the test file or its imports
- `Cannot find module` / `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`
- Runner reports zero tests executed (`# tests 0`, `\b0 tests?\b`)

These crashes exit non-zero but verify nothing — accepting them as RED wedges
the subsequent GREEN phase (same crash repeats regardless of source edits).
Stack-frame lines (`  at …`) and lines inside a reported test's `details:`
block are ignored, so `assert.throws(ReferenceError)` remains a valid RED.

**Recovery (this is NOT a bypass, NOT a behavior gap):** fix the test file so
it loads cleanly and produces a real assertion failure, then re-run
`tdd-phase-state.js record-red`. Each rejection appends a
`tdd-red-load-failure-rejected` row to `.work-actions.json` via
`appendEnforcementAudit` (action: `tdd-red-load-failure-rejected`,
`allow: false`, `meta: { cycle, testCommand, signature, snippet }`).
